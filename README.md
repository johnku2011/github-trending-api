# GitHub Trending API

A FastAPI-based REST API that scrapes and serves GitHub's trending repositories information. This API allows you to fetch trending repositories with various time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) and includes detailed repository information such as stars, forks, and descriptions.

## Motivation
Building this as current Github API doesn't have the trending repo data, have searchde online for online sources but the data format isn't what I want.
Please feel free to use and enhance the API.

Implemented the API in a Coze Bot: https://www.coze.com/store/agent/7476082421604155409
